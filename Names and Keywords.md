# Names
- A name can be any sequence of upper or lowercase letters A to Z or a to z, the digits 0 to 9, and the underscore character, _.
- A name must begin with either a letter or an underscore.
- Names are case sensitive.
The C++ standard allows names to be of any length, but typically a particular compiler will impose some sort of limit. 
However, this is normally sufficiently large that it doesn’t represent a serious constraint.
Most of the time you won’t need to use names of more than 12 to 15 characters.

#### Here are some valid C++ names:
```
toe_count   shoeSize  Box    democrat     Democrat     number1    x2    y2     pValue     out_of_range  HI  _HI 
```
- Uppercase and lowercase are differentiated, so democrat is not the same name as Democrat.
- HI and _HI is both are different names.
# KEYWORDS
-Keywords are reserved words that have a specific meaning in C++, so you must not use them for other purposes.
```
class    double   throw   catch 
```
### Other names that you are not supposed to use include the following:
- Names that begin with two consecutive underscores
- Names that begin with an underscore followed by an uppercase letter
- Within the global namespace: all names that begin with an underscore

■ Tip    Do not use names that start with an underscore.
