# Name
- A name can be any sequence of upper or lowercase letters A to Z or a to z, the digits 0 to 9, and the underscore character, _.
- A name must begin with either a letter or an underscore.
- Names are case sensitive.
The C++ standard allows names to be of any length, but typically a particular compiler will impose some sort of limit. 
However, this is normally sufficiently large that it doesn’t represent a serious constraint.
Most of the time you won’t need to use names of more than 12 to 15 characters.

#### Here are some valid C++ names:
```
toe_count   shoeSize  Box    `democrat`     `Democrat`     `number1`    `x2`    `y2`     `pValue`     `out_of_range`
```
